# Air-Draw
The purpose of this application is to provide a convenient and flexible solution for online meetings and classes that require a whiteboard. The traditional whiteboard and marker may not be available or accessible in certain situations, which can make it difficult for teachers and presenters to convey their ideas effectively. My application aims to bridge this gap by providing an interactive virtual whiteboard that can be used in real-time during online meetings or smart classes.
